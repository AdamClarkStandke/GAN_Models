# Theoretical underpinnings of GAN and DCGAN
As detailed in the book [Advanced Deep Learning with Python: Design and implement advanced next-generation AI solutions using TensorFlow and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Deep-Learning-Python-next-generation/dp/178995617X) by Ivan Vasilev. The DCGAN stems from the landmark paper introduced in 2014 titled [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf) The implementation of the paper's algorithm comes from a tensorflow tutorial titled [dcgan](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)
## The generator: 
> To learn the generator‚Äôs distribution p<sub>g</sub> over data **x**, we define a prior on input noise variable p<sub>z</sub>(**z**), then represent a mapping to data space as G(**z**;Œ∏<sub>g</sub>), where G is a differential function represented by a multilayer perceptron with parameters Œ∏<sub>g</sub> [^1]. 
This is represented by the following code:
```python
# function that builds the generator
def build_generator(latent_input, weight_initialization, channel):
  model = Sequential(name='generator')
  # first fully connected layer to take in 1D latent vector/tensor z
  # and output a 1D tensor of size 12,544
  model.add(keras.layers.Dense(7*7*256, input_shape=(latent_input,)))
  # applies a transformation that maintains the mean output close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1
  # stabilizes training after the conv layer and before the activation function
  model.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  # activation function
  model.add(keras.layers.ReLU())
  # reshape previous layer into a 3D tensor 
  model.add(keras.layers.Reshape((7, 7, 256)))
  # first layer of upsampeling(i.e. deconvolution) of the 3D tensor to output a 7x7 feature map as determined by the stride  
  model.add(keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=128, kernel_size=(5,5), strides=(1,1), padding='same', kernel_initializer=weight_initialization))
  model.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization()) 
  model.add(keras.layers.ReLU()) 
  # second layer of upsampeling(i.e. deconvolution) in which the volume depth is reduced to 64 
  # and outputs a feature map of size 14x14 as determined by the stride
  model.add(keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=64, kernel_size=(5,5), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=weight_initialization)) 
  model.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(keras.layers.ReLU()) 
  # third layer upsampeling(i.e. deconvolution) in which the volume depth is reduced to 1 and the image is output as 28x28x1
  model.add(keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=channel, kernel_size=(5,5), strides=(2,2), padding='same', activation='tanh'))
  return model
```
Which is represented by the below image as found in the 2016 paper titled [UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) 
![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-21%201.22.59%20AM.png "DCGAN generator")[^2].
## The discriminator:
> We also define a second multilayer perceptron D(**x**;Œ∏<sub>d</sub>) that outputs a single scalar. D(**x**) represents the probability
that **x** came from the data rather than p<sub>g</sub>.[^1].
This is represented by the following code:
```python
def build_discriminator(width, height, depth, alpha=0.2):
  model = Sequential(name='discriminator')
  input_shape = (height, width, depth)
  # first layer of discriminator network that downsamples image to 14x14 as determined by stride and 
  # increases depth by 64
  model.add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(2,2), padding='same', input_shape = input_shape))
  model.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=alpha))
  # second layer of discriminator network that downsamples image to 7x7 and increaes depth to 128
  model.add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
  model.add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=alpha))
  # flatten 3D tensor to 1D tensor of size 7*7*128 = 6727
  model.add(keras.layers.Flatten()) 
  # apply dropout of 30% before feeding it to the dense layer
  model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.3))
  model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) 
  return model
```
## GAN Loss function:
> We train D to maximize the probability of assigning the correct label to both training examples and samples from G. We simultaneously train G to minimize log(1 ‚àí D(G(**z**))). In other words, D and G play the following two-player minimax game with
value function V(G, D):
![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-21%202.20.44%20AM.png "value function")[^1].
However as the authors of the paper note this objective function does not perform in practice, since it may not provide sufficient gradients for the generator to acutally learn, especially during the early stages of learning when the discriminator is very accurate (i.e. outputing 0 rather than 1 so the gradient will be 0 and the weights of the generator will not move). So rather than training the generator to minimize log(1-D(G(**z**))), training is done to maximize log D(G(**z**)).[^1].

# Theoretical underpinnings of Conditional GAN and Supervised Pix2Pix 
As detailed in the book [Advanced Deep Learning with Python: Design and implement advanced next-generation AI solutions using TensorFlow and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Deep-Learning-Python-next-generation/dp/178995617X) by Ivan Vasilev. The Pix2Pix paper [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf) develops upon ideas from the paper titled [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) introduced in 2014. The implementation of the Pix2Pix algorithm comes from a tensorflow tutorial titled [pix2pix: Image-to-image translation with a conditional GAN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix).

## Conditional GAN:
> Generative adversarial nets can be extended to a conditional model if both the generator and discriminator are conditioned on some extra information **y**. **y** could be any kind of auxiliary information, such as class labels or data from other modalities. We can perform the conditioning by feeding **y** into the both the discriminator and generator as additional input layer. In the generator the *prior distribution of input noise* p<sub>z</sub>(**z**), and **y** are combined in *joint hidden representation/distribution*, and the adversarial training framework allows for considerable flexibility in how this *joint hidden representation/distribution* is composed. [^4].

> [^3].

## Conditional GAN Loss function:
D and G play the following two-player minimax game with the following value function V(G, D):

![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/conditional_value_func.png "conditional value function")[^4].

## Supervised Pix2Pix:
Supervised Pix2Pix is a conditional GAN with an additional loss constraining the generator, which the paper outlines in section 3.1 is a L1 loss rather than the traidtional L2 loss. This helps with blurring.[^5].

## Supervised Pix2Pix Loss function:

![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-26%2011.50.28%20PM.png "generator l1 loss")[^5].

![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-26%2011.50.51%20PM.png "total loss")[^5].

The architecture for the generator is described by the paper as the following:
> To give the generator a means to circumvent the bottleneck for information like this, we add skip connections, following the general shape of a ‚ÄúU-Net‚Äù... Specifically, we add **skip connections between each layer i and layer n ‚àí i, where n is the total number of layers. Each skip connection simply concatenates all channels at layer i with those at layer n ‚àí i**.[^5].
The architecture for the discriminator is described by the paper as the following:
> [To motivate the GAN discriminator to only model high-frequency structures in image that are generated] it is sufficient to restrict our attention to
the structure in local image patches. Therefore, we design
a discriminator architecture ‚Äì which we term a **PatchGAN
‚Äì that only penalizes structure at the scale of patches. This
discriminator tries to classify if each N √óN patch in an image as real or fake**. We run this discriminator convolutionally across the image, averaging all responses to provide the ultimate output of D.[^5].

### Example 3: Supervised Pix2Pix for Image Segmentation on the Cityscapes Dataset
The objective of this task is to transform a set of real-world images from the Cityscapes dataset[^7] into semantic segmentations. The dataset contains 5,000 finely annotated images split into training, and validation sets (i.e. 2975/500 split). The dense annotation contains 30 common classes of road, person, car, etc. as detailed by the following figure [^8]: 

![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/labels%20of%20colors.png "classes") 

**Default Pix2Pix Model**:
After training the semantic segementation generator for 40,000 steps it was tested on the test set of the [Cityscape Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) The following five test results were outputted to compare the actual semantic segmentation i.e. ground truth to the semantic segmentaion generator i.e. predicted image:

The default semantic segmentation generator model weights can be found here: [Default Semantic Segmentation Generator Model](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/saved_model.pb)

**Custom Pix2Pix Model**:
This time the Pix2Pix generator was trained for 25,000 steps and used a lambada value of 1000 for the l1 loss function. Since the L1 loss  regularizes the generator model to output predicted images that are plausible translations of the source image, I decided to weight it 1 order of magnitude higher than [^5] especially when it came to segmenting riders(seemed to help). The following five test results were outputted detailing the some of the preditions of the semantic segmentaion generator i.e. predicted image [^9].

# Theoretical underpinnings of Cycle-Consistent Adverserial Networks (CycleGAN)
Unlike Pix2Pix in which paired training was required i.e. need both input and target pairs, CycleGan works on unpaired data i.e. no information is provided as to which input matches to which target.[^6]

## Unsupervised CycleGAN Loss function:
> Our objective contains two types of terms: adversarial losses for matching the distribution of generated images to the data distribution in the target domain; and cycle consistency losses to prevent the learned mappings G and F from contradicting each other 
> 
> ![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/CycleGanLoss.png "total loss")
>
> We apply an adversarial losses to both mapping functions. For the mapping function G : X ‚Üí Y and its discriminator D<sub>Y</sub> , we express the objective as:
>
> ![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/adverserialLoss.png "adverserial loss")
>
> where G tries to generate images G(*x*) that look similar to images from domain Y , while D<sub>Y</sub> aims to distinguish between translated samples G(*x*) and real samples *y*. G aims to minimize this objective against an adversary D that tries to maximize it, i.e., min<sub>G</sub>max<sub>D<sub>Y</sub></sub> *L*<sub>GAN</sub>(G, D<sub>Y</sub> , X, Y). We introduce a similar adversarial loss for the mapping function F : Y ‚Üí X and its discriminator D<sub>X</sub> as well: i.e., min<sub>F</sub>max<sub>D<sub>X</sub></sub> *L*<sub>GAN</sub>(F, D<sub>X</sub>, Y, X).
> 
>Adversarial training can, in theory, learn mappings G
and F that produce outputs identically distributed as target
domains Y and X respectively. However,
with large enough capacity, a network can map the same
set of input images to any random permutation of images in
the target domain, where any of the learned mappings can
induce an output distribution that matches the target distribution. Thus, adversarial losses alone cannot guarantee
that the learned function can map an individual input *x*<sub>i</sub> to a desired output *y*<sub>i</sub> Thus to reduce the space of possible mapping functions, a constraint is introduced in which the mapping functions should be cycle-consistent in the forward direction i.e. x ‚Üí G(x) ‚Üí F(G(x)) ‚âà x and in the backward direction y ‚Üí F(y) ‚Üí G(F(y)) ‚âà y 
>
> ![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/cycleloss.png "cycle consistency loss")
> 
> Furthermore, for mapping paintings to photos (and thus also, photos to paintings), we find that it is helpful to introduce an additional loss to encourage the mapping to preserve color composition between the input and output. In particular, we adopt the technique of Taigman et al. and regularize the generator to be near an identity mapping when real samples of the target domain are provided as the input to the generator: 
> 
> ![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/identloss.png "identity loss")
> 
> Without L<sub>identity</sub>, the generator G and F are free to change the tint of input images when there is no need to. For example, when learning the mapping between Monet‚Äôs paintings and Flickr photographs, the generator often maps paintings of daytime to photographs taken during sunset, because such a mapping may be equally valid under the adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss

### Example 4: Unsupervised CyleGAN for Image Segmentation on the Cityscape Images
The objective of this task is to transform a set of real-world images from the Cityscapes dataset[^7] into semantic segmentations. The dataset contains 5,000 finely annotated images split into training, and validation sets (i.e. 2975/500 split). The dense annotation contains 30 common classes of road, person, car, etc. as detailed by the following figure [^8]: 

![alt text](https://github.com/aCStandke/GAN_Models/blob/main/labels%20of%20colors.png "classes") 

Each of the models were trained for 10 epochs, even though they should be trained at least for 100 epochs(and the paper trained for 200 epochs). However, due to CycleGANs being very computationally intensive even when using a GPU(or a hardware accelerator like TPU).For example, to do 10 epochs, which amounts to 29,750 steps of training it took 11 hours! So for 200 epochs, it would take 2 days of training, lol I am not that devoted but the results would be much better! 

Because of the low number of epochs, I decide to play with the loss functions for the CycleGAN implementation using the Pix2Pix U-net Backbone. In addition to using Binary Cross-entropy, I decided to try using Binary Focal Cross-Entropy as detailed by [^10] Focal Cross-Entropy was developed for object detection, but as the authors detail: 

> The Focal Loss is designed to address the one-stage object detection scenario in which there is an extreme imbalance between foreground and background classes during training (e.g., 1:1000)...[a] common method for addressing class imbalance is to introduce a weighting factor Œ± ‚àà [0,1] for class 1 and 1‚àíŒ± for class ‚àí1 (i.e. balanced cross-entropy)...[w]hile Œ± balances the importance of positive/negative examples, it
*does not differentiate between easy/hard examples. Instead, we propose to reshape the loss function to down-weight easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives* 
> The novel loss is defined as: FL(p<sub>t</sub>) = ‚àí(1 ‚àí p<sub>t</sub>)<sup>Œ≥</sup>log(p<sub>t</sub>).[^10]

I decided to try this loss out, since the cityscape data set is very imbalenced in regards to easy images (i.e. an alleyway with just cars) versus hard images (i.e. a pedestrian cross-walk with different car types like trucks, motorcycles, people, bikes,and traffic signs).

In addition to the focal loss I wanted to see the effect that an Image buffer would have in regards to better segmentations. As the authors state:  

> [T]o reduce model oscillation... we...update discriminators D<sub>X</sub> and D<sub>Y</sub> using a history of generated images rather than the ones produced by the latest generative networks. We keep an image buffer that stores the 50 previously generated images.[^9]

To implement this image buffer I turned to the CycleGAN implementation done by Xiaowei-hu which can be found here: [CycleGAN](https://github.com/xiaowei-hu/CycleGAN-tensorflow). After playing around with the sizes, I realized that a buffer of 50 was way to big for the number of epochs I was using. Because I noticed that generally the generators produced pretty accurate segmentaions for a short range, an upper limit of 5 was decided on (lol using my sixth sense).
