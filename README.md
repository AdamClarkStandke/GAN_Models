Using a deep convolution GAN to create fashion clothes from a Gaussian distribution trained using the MINST fashion data set. **_Click below on the picture of [Daphne](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpIqTXVAk0a14YdkWX-hn9Q) to show the video of the transformation from random noise into actual fashion clothes that I think Daphne would include in her wardrobe! ðŸ‘— (espically if its a [White Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Party))
